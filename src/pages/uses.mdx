Here's a list of the tools, software and many other things that I use on a daily basis. This page was inspired by Wes Bos and his project - [uses.tech](https://uses.tech). If you make your own, I'd love to see it!

# Web
## Browser
Firefox, naturally. I really like the ability to customize the interface using CSS, and it had a sidebar before it was cool.

# Desktop apps
I have a desktop and laptop that I love dearly.

import Card from "@/components/cards/card.tsx"

<div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <Card>
  **Desktop**
  OS: Windows 11
  CPU: Intel Core i5-10600KF
  GPU: Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti 16gb
  32gb RAM; 512gb SSD; 6tb HDD
  </Card>
  <Card>
  **Laptop**
  OS: Windows 11
  Model: ASUS Zenbook
  CPU: AMD Ryzen 7-7730U
  16gb RAM; 512gb SSD
  </Card>
</div>

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) - Notion is great for organizing tasks in just the right way for me, and it can hold notes and my game backlog too.
- [Notion Calendar](https://calendar.notion.so) - I use this to keep track of my class schedule and deadlines.
- [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/) - As far as I know, Spark is the only nice-looking native Windows mail app with categories.
- [Yasb](https://github.com/amnweb/yasb) - A highly configurable Windows status bar written in Python.
- [Microsoft Powertoys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) - A collection of utilities you'd be be a tool to miss. Run and Color Picker are my favorites!
- [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) - Screenshotting and screen recording app.
- [Vividl](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vividl/) - Great free YouTube video downloader. Functionally a frontend for yt-dlp so it doesn't usually break.

# Homelab
This is how I got into programming in the first place. There's no magic quite like wiring up 6 Docker containers on a $150 Windows box and getting a website out of it, and I've continued that for about 6 years to my still-modest current setup.
<Card>
  **Inkstation**
  OS: OpenMediaVault
  CPU: Intel i5-2500S 
  Uptime: too long
  16gb RAM; 256gb SSD; 8tb HDD
</Card>
A homelab is nothing without apps. These ones are my favorites, either because they're the best of the alternatives I tried or they're just really cool:
- [Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/) - No-nonsense auth provider that makes securing other apps straightforward.
- [Bluemap](https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/) - Serves 3D maps of Minecraft worlds over the web. Check out [mcarchive.tsuni.dev](https://mcarchive.tsuni.dev)!
- [Caddy-Docker-Proxy](https://github.com/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy) - Wonderful Caddy extension that makes deploying new containers to a subdomain as [easy as 2 labels on a container](https://gist.github.com/TetraTsunami/11dcda9bbbccb56416f773ddda376b99).
- [Calibre-web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web) - Drop-in replacement for my Kobo e-reader's sync server, allowing me to get books to it from anywhere.
- [Croc](https://schollz.com/tinker/croc/) - Super simple CLI file transfer tool that works over the internet. Not used often but handy for VPSes, school computers, and other quick-and-dirty transfers.
- [Foundry](https://foundryvtt.com/) - Excellent web-based VTT for tabletop roleplaying games
- [n8n](https://n8n.io/) - Node-based automation platform. Syncs my Canvas assignments to Notion, grabs data for my game backlog, and a whole host of other small things.
- [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) - Analytics that are super easy to just slot into any project
- [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) - Media server extaordinaire. Music support is much better than Jellyfin's equivalent.
- [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/) - Host and manage many game servers. Much less management work than running them bare.
- [Seafile](https://www.seafile.com/en/home/) - File storage with rock-solid sync and direct-download share links
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) - Allows me to access this server and my 3 VPSes without exposing them to the web. Taildrop allows me to quickly & wirelessly transfer files between iOS and Windows without being on the same network.
- [YouTubeCast](https://github.com/trevorsharp/youtubecast) - Add YouTube channels to my podcast app so I can listen to them on my own time.
